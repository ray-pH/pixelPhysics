# pixelPhysics

pixelPhysics is a project about grid based real time physics simulation (in a pixelated style). Available at [https://ray-ph.github.io/pixelPhysics/](https://ray-ph.github.io/pixelPhysics/).

# Simulation
Each type of simulation is hosted in it's own repository
- [Quantum Mechanics](https://github.com/ray-pH/px_qWavefun)
- [Gravity (N Body)](https://github.com/ray-pH/px_pxGravity)
- [Fluid Flow](https://github.com/ray-pH/px_fluidFlow)
